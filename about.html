          <h1>Hi, I'm William.</h1>
          <p>
              Welcome to my website! I'm a hobbyist software developer based in Berkeley, California. I am a third year Chemical Engineering major and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Minor at U.C. Berkeley. I have interests in mobile, web, and game development. <br> <br>

              <h1 id = "entry-header-left">Design Philosophy</h1>
              My goal is to develop programs, games, and interfaces that are refreshing and inviting. I believe that design is in the details. When strong standalone components are brought together in a unique way, users are able to experience something new yet familiar. I seek to capture this feeling in everything that I code, draw, and design.

      <div>
        <h1 id = "entry-header-right">Skills</h1>
        I am most comfortable coding in Java, Python, and C. In terms of web development, I have worked with HTML, CSS, Django, and Javascript. I am also familiar with scripting in Matlab, dynamic modelling using Matlab, and CAD software such as SolidWorks. For game production, I mainly use Java with the LibGDX framework, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for Graphics, and FLStudio for music and sound.
